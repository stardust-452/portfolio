<h2>Sequencing-Based Analysis of Chemotherapy-Induced DNA Damage Response (DDR)</h2>
This project involved studying the DNA Damage Repsonse (DDR) of a chemotherapeutic drug on a human cell line through sequencing methods, namely RNA Seq and ChIP Seq. RNA Seq analysis was used to study the changes between the
treated vs untreated samples and treatment at different doses of the drug. ChIP Seq was used to identify the changes in the peaks of a DNA binding protein. The codes include RNA Seq analysis and ChIP Seq analysis.
<p>The results have not been published and thus can't be shared but I have attached some replicated results from a paper.</p>
<p>This project was done at Gedit lab, IISER Thiruvananthapuram. </p>
