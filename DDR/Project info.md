# Drug DNA Damage Response
This project involved studying the DNA Damage Repsonse (DDR) of a cancer drug on a human cell line through sequencing methods, namely RNA Seq and ChIP Seq. RNA Seq analysis was used to study the changes between the
treated vs untreated samples and treatment at different doses of the drug. ChIP Seq was used to identify the changes in the peaks of a DNA binding protein. The codes include RNA Seq analysis, ChIP Seq analysis and 
Pathway analysis.
