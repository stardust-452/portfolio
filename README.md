Hi! I am Nupur Upadhyay, a fourth-year BS-MS Biology major and Data Science minor student at IISER Thiruvanathapuram, Kerala, India. I am interested in research in Bioinformatics with a focus on Genomics.
<p>This repository contains information, including the code and selected output files for the projects that I have completed. All the projects are stored as different folders with a project description for each.</p>
